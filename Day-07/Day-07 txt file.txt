1. Get the Calendar and Date

cal    # Displays the current month's calendar
date   # Displays the current date and time

2. Get Student Name and Marks for 3 Subjects


read -p "Enter student name: " name


read -p "Enter marks for 1st subject: " sub1
read -p "Enter marks for 2nd subject: " sub2
read -p "Enter marks for 3rd subject: " sub3


total=$((sub1 + sub2 + sub3))

# Display results
echo "Name: $name"
echo "1st Subject: $sub1"
echo "2nd Subject: $sub2"
echo "3rd Subject: $sub3"
echo "Total: $total"

3. Create a Calculator with Arithmetic Operators


read -p "Enter the first number: " num1
read -p "Enter the second number: " num2


summation=$((num1 + num2))
subtraction=$((num1 - num2))
division=$((num1 / num2))
multiplication=$((num1 * num2))

# Display results
echo "Summation: $summation"
echo "Subtraction: $subtraction"
echo "Division: $division"
echo "Multiplication: $multiplication"

4. Get Day Based on User Input Number

echo "Enter the number (1-7):"
read number

case $number in
    1) echo "Monday" ;;
    2) echo "Tuesday" ;;
    3) echo "Wednesday" ;;
    4) echo "Thursday" ;;
    5) echo "Friday" ;;
    6) echo "Saturday" ;;
    7) echo "Sunday" ;;
    *) echo "Unrecognized number" ;;
esac

5. Verify User Name

#my user id
whoami

valid_user="2021ict113"

read -p "Enter user name: " enter_user

if [ "$enter_user" == "$valid_user" ]; then
    echo "User name is correct"
else
    echo "User name is incorrect"
fi

6. Compare Two Numbers

echo "Enter two numbers:"
read num1 num2

if [ "$num1" -gt "$num2" ]; then
    echo "$num1 is greater than $num2"
elif [ "$num1" -lt "$num2" ]; then
    echo "$num1 is less than $num2"
else
    echo "$num1 is equal to $num2"
fi

7. Create Simple Calculator Using expr



read -p "Enter the first number: " num1
read -p "Enter the second number: " num2

# using expr
summation=$(expr $num1 + $num2)
subtraction=$(expr $num1 - $num2)
division=$(expr $num1 / $num2)
multiplication=$(expr $num1 \* $num2)


echo "Summation: $summation"
echo "Subtraction: $subtraction"
echo "Division: $division"
echo "Multiplication: $multiplication"
