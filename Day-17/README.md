ðŸ”¢ Multi-Process Number Operations in C
This C program demonstrates the use of process creation using fork() and basic inter-process computation. It allows the user to enter three numbers and then uses child processes to perform different mathematical tasks in parallel.

ðŸ§  What It Does
Takes three user inputs: A, B, and C

Spawns two child processes:

ðŸ‘¶ Child Q computes the factorial of A

ðŸ‘¶ Child A computes the Fibonacci series up to C terms and checks if C is a prime number

ðŸ§“ The parent process waits for both children to complete

ðŸ’¡ Features
âœ… Demonstrates use of fork(), exit(), and wait() system calls

âœ… Implements three classic algorithms:

Factorial calculation

Fibonacci series generation

Prime number checking

âœ… Proper separation of logic across processes

âœ… Console-based user interaction
