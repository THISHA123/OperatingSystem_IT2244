# Command

head -8 abc.tsv | tail -n1

What It Does:
1. head -8 abc.tsv → Extracts the first 8 lines of abc.tsv.

2. | (Pipe) → Passes the output of head as input to tail.

3. tail -n1 → Extracts only the last (8th) line from the previous output.

This command displays only the 8th line of abc.tsv


#Command 

awk -F'\t' '{print NF; exit}' abc.tsv

1. -F'\t' → Sets the field separator as a tab (\t) because abc.tsv is a TSV (Tab-Separated Values) file.

2. NF → Prints the number of fields (columns) in the first row.

3. exit → Ensures that awk only processes the first line, making it efficient.

Displays the number of columns in abc.tsv

#Command

head -n10 abc.tsv | grep 'bb'

1. head -n10 abc.tsv → Extracts the first 10 lines of abc.tsv.

2. | (Pipe) → Passes the output of head as input to grep.

3. grep 'bb' → Searches for lines containing the string "bb" within those first 10 lines.

Displays all lines from the first 10 of abc.tsv that contain "bb".
