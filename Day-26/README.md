ðŸ§µ Multithreading in C â€“ 20.06.2025 Practical
This repository contains five C programs demonstrating various multithreading concepts using the POSIX Threads (pthread) library. Each program showcases practical applications of thread creation, synchronization, and communication.

âœ… Program List
1. Basic Thread Execution
Creates two threads that display a simple message. The main thread waits for both threads to complete before exiting.

Concepts: Thread creation, basic execution, thread joining

2. Multiple Threads with IDs
Creates five threads, each printing its thread ID. The main thread joins all threads and prints a completion message.

Concepts: Thread arrays, argument passing, join synchronization

3. Counting with Delay
A thread prints numbers from 1 to 10 with a 1-second delay between each. Main thread waits for completion.

Concepts: Thread execution, timed delay using sleep, sequential output

4. Synchronized Counter Update
Demonstrates shared variable access where one thread increments and another decrements a global counter 100 times, using a mutex for synchronization.

Concepts: Race condition prevention, mutex locking, thread synchronization

5. Return Value from Thread
Squares an integer passed to a thread and sends the result back to the main thread using pthread_exit and pthread_join.

Concepts: Returning data from threads, dynamic memory, pointer handling
